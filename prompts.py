# INTENT CLASSIFICATION PROMPTS
# =============================================================================

INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant that classifies user intents for a voice-controlled pair programming system.

Analyze this user request and classify it into one of these categories:

1. **coding** - User wants to write, create, build, or generate code
   Examples: "write a function", "create a class", "build an API", "make a script"

2. **discussion** - User asks questions, wants explanations, or general conversation
   Examples: "what is recursion?", "how does this work?", "explain the algorithm", "can you help me understand?"

3. **file_operations** - User wants to open, read, edit, or manage files
   Examples: "open file.py", "read the config file", "show me the contents", "edit main.py"

4. **code_analysis** - User wants to analyze, explain, review, or debug existing code
   Examples: "explain this code", "what does this function do?", "review my code", "analyze this snippet", "debug this code", "optimize this function"

5. **exit** - User wants to end the session (handled separately)

User request: "{user_request}"

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- intent: one of ["coding", "discussion", "file_operations", "code_analysis"]
- confidence: float between 0.0 and 1.0
- action: specific action to take
- extracted_info: any relevant extracted information (like file names, code requirements, analysis type, etc.)
- message: brief explanation of the classification

Example responses:
{{"intent": "coding", "confidence": 0.95, "action": "generate_code", "extracted_info": {{"task": "create a sorting function"}}, "message": "User wants to create code"}}
{{"intent": "code_analysis", "confidence": 0.90, "action": "analyze_code", "extracted_info": {{"analysis_type": "explain"}}, "message": "User wants to analyze existing code"}}

1. **Performance improvements** - Speed or memory optimizations
2. **Code quality** - Readability and maintainability improvements  
3. **Best practices** - Modern patterns and techniques
4. **Specific suggestions** - Concrete changes to make

Keep suggestions practical and explain the benefits clearly for voice delivery."""

CODE_DEBUG_PROMPT = """You are a debugging expert analyzing code for potential issues.

Code to debug:
```{language}
{code}

Analyze for potential issues in a voice-friendly way:

1. **Potential bugs** - Logic errors, edge cases, null checks
2. **Common pitfalls** - Typical mistakes in this type of code
3. **Error handling** - Missing try-catch or validation
4. **Recommendations** - How to make the code more robust

Focus on the most likely issues and explain them clearly for voice."""

TODO_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert software engineer who breaks down coding requests into clear, actionable to-do items.

Your task is to convert user requests into a structured list of specific coding tasks that can be implemented step by step.

Guidelines:
1. Break down the request into logical, sequential steps
2. Each task should be specific and actionable
3. Include all necessary components (functions, classes, error handling, etc.)
4. Consider edge cases and best practices
5. Make tasks granular enough to be implemented individually
6. Return ONLY a numbered list, no additional text

Example:
Request: "Build me a recursive factorial function"
Response:
1. Create a factorial function with parameter validation
2. Implement base case for factorial(0) and factorial(1)
